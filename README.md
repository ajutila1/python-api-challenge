1. There is a srong correlation between latitude and max temperature, in which the closer a city is to the equator, the higher its max temperature is generally.
2. There is a weak correlation between latitude and humidity, in which the closer a city is to the equator, the tighter the spread of humidity in the higher percentages. As cities move away from the equator, the spread of humidity data points becomes greater.
3. There does not appear to be a correlation between latitude and wind speed in the North Hemisphere, but there does appear to be a correlation between the two in the Southern Hemisphere. This might be explained by the relatively smaller amount of land mass in the Southern Hemisphere past 40 degrees latitude heading towards the South Pole, in which greater number of coastal areas would increase overall windspeed the further south cities are.
